TorBar
======

Menu bar Tor relay server app for OSX.

To do
--------

Network Detection: Detect wifi/network changes and only run tor on networks where user has manually turned on tor. If the user turns off tor on a network, also remember this as a preference for that network.

Autolaunch: have app autolaunch on startup or option to do so?

Bandwidth: add code to grab bandwidth usage info from logs or another means and display in menu bar?
